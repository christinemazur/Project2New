ETL Project by Charlene, Christine and Sathya

* The Purpose of the project was to extract Donald Trump tweets and Dow Jones Industrial Average for 2 years and transform that data using Jupyter notebook and then load the data to Postgres data base for future analysis.


* Used Data Extraction, Transform and Load (ETL) methods throughout the project.


* Easiest part was to load data to database using PostgreSQL.


* Hardest part was to find data from reliable sources for the project.


* We learned that ETL data can be used as a good source for future data analysis; for an example ETL data in this project can be used to see whether Trump tweets has an effect on Dow fluctuations.
